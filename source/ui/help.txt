This program implements some algorithms that compute the mutual information
exchanged between two or more protein complexes. It is based on an article
written in 2009 by T. Lenaerts et al.

Because the main purpose is to compute the mutual information,
there are few things the user can do from the menu. The choices
are:

**** Load a file ****

This option allows the user to load a formatted file (with the extension .comp).
This will create internly the ADTs that the program needed in order to compute the required
data.

**** Save data ****

This option allows the user to save data into a formatted file. The user will
have to enter several data before the save is done.

**** Start the Algorithm ****

This is the main option of the program. After some additional info have been given,
the algorithm will start. The progress of the algorithm will be displayed on the ui.



The process of the program is defined as follows:
	
	- (optional) The user saves some data using the save choice.
	- (required) The user loads the data that will be used by the program.
	- (required) The user chooses the start choice.
	- (required) The user chooses if he wants a bivariate or a trivariate mutal information.
	- (required) The user chooses the input, channel and output.
	- (required) The user chooses the interval and the step of the input, channel and output (this will be used during the computations).
